== Installation ==

* Unzip the Beautiful Social Web Link plugin in the plugins folder in wp-content directory i.e `wp-content/plugins`.
* Go to your wordpress site admin and plugins section and activate the Beautiful Social Web Link plugin

== Other Notes ==

* In case you want to add a social web site that is not present in the current list in the [admin panel](http://howitworkz.com/wordpress/beautiful-social-web-link/ "Plugin Page"). All you have to do is create an image icon of that site or download from internet (.png or .jpg or .gif), give it an appropriate name (e.g. Facebook.jpg or Facebook.png ) and drop it into the " beautiful-social-web-link/images " folder in the [plugin](http://howitworkz.com/wordpress/beautiful-social-web-link/ "Plugin Page") directory. NO NEED TO HACK THE CODE :). If you want to use your own set of icons, you can replace all the images in the " beautiful-social-web-link/images " folder with your set of images.
* Note there are two set of subfolder in images folder i.e. 16x16 and 32x32. They represent the size of icons. So when you add your own icon, make sure that your icon is of both sizes 16x16 and 32x32.
* Incase if your web server has blocked opening file urls, then read one of the comments on the [plugin homepage](http://howitworkz.com/wordpress/beautiful-social-web-link/ "Plugin Page") to know how to work around this problem.
